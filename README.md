### ðŸ¤” Overview
The Contact app I created using Android Studio and Java offers users a streamlined interface to manage their contacts effectively. With three distinct layouts, users can navigate seamlessly through their contacts. The home layout serves as a hub, presenting all contacts along with the option to mark favorites for quick access. Upon selecting a contact, the second layout provides comprehensive details including name, phone number, and call history, alongside convenient buttons for various actions like editing, deleting, messaging, calling, and video calling. The third layout offers a user-friendly form for adding new contacts or editing existing ones. While the app doesn't rely on a database, it efficiently utilizes hardcoded contact lists and includes an array of profile pictures for enhanced personalization. Designed meticulously using Figma, the app prioritizes both functionality and visual appeal, ensuring a seamless user experience throughout.
